These objects are consist of the following fields:\r\n\r\n* value: Text content\r\n* added: True if the value was inserted into the new string\r\n* removed: True of the value was removed from the old string\r\n\r\nNote that some cases may omit a particular flag field. Comparison on the flag fields should always be done in a truthy or falsy manner.\r\n\r\n## [Example](http://kpdecker.github.com/jsdiff)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSoftware License Agreement (BSD License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2009-2011, Kevin Decker kpdecker@gmail.com\r\n\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use of this software in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\r\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above\r\n  copyright notice, this list of conditions and the\r\n  following disclaimer.\r\n\r\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above\r\n  copyright notice, this list of conditions and the\r\n  following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other\r\n  materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\n* Neither the name of Kevin Decker nor the names of its\r\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\r\n  derived from this software without specific prior\r\n  written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
