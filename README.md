## About Atom
[Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/)

 Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on [atom-shell](http://github.com/atom/atom-shell), and based on everything we love about our favorite editors. We designed it to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.
